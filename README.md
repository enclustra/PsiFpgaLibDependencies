# Description
This package allows parsing PSI library dependencies from the standard README.md files. Dependencies can then be listed, checked out or added as submodule to a project.

To parse the dependencies correctly, the README.md file must follow the PSI standard:
* Separate section **# Dependencies**
* In that section, dependencies are listed in a bullet list
* Add indent for every folder level
* Add submodules in the form **\[name\]\(url\)(1.0.0)**
* For an example, look at the repository mentioned below

For the exact usage, refer to the [psi_common Library](https://github.com/paulscherrerinstitute/psi_common).
